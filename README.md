# Intelligent-Traffic-System
An intelligent traffic management system that tries to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion in a city. Each agent in the system is responsible for a specific task, such as monitoring traffic, controlling traffic signals, coordinating emergency services, and providing real-time traffic information to motorists.

Agent Positions:


Traffic Monitoring Agent: This agent uses sensors, cameras, or other data sources to monitor traffic conditions and relay the data to other agents. To maintain smooth traffic flow, the traffic control agent controls traffic signals based on data from the monitoring agent. To minimize traffic disruptions, emergency services agents coordinate and monitor emergency situations.


Driver Assistance Agent: Provides real-time traffic information, alternate routes, and other information to drivers via a mobile application or other means.


Data analytics agent: Identifies patterns in both past and current traffic data, forecasts congestion, and offers optimization tactics.


Centralized Coordinator Agent: Oversees the coordination of the entire system, agent interactions, and decision-making procedures.


Reporting Agent: Produces reports and visualizations for city officials or other stakeholders using traffic data.

For running the code, Jade will need to be installed and set up in Eclipse or IntelliJ (or any other Java IDE).
